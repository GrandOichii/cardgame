== Card types ==

    = Source =
Source are cards that fuel the players' energy.
By casting a source card, a player gets a permanent 1 to their maximum energy reserve.
Players can play only one Source card per turn.



    = Unit =
Units are used for attacking the enemy directly or their treasures.
A unit can be placed by each player on a lane. Only one unit can be on each side of the table. 
If a player would play a unit on a lane, where they already have a unit, the unit is replaced.
A unit has life and power.
If a unit's life would reach 0, they get destroyed.
Units can attack. If a unit would attack on a lane, where there is a defensive unit, they each deal damage to each other simultaneously.

Example:
    [Forest Shaman]
    cost: 3
    power: 2
    defence: 3
    text: TODO



    = Charm =
Charms are cards played on lanes to give benefitial/detremental effects.
Only one charm can be played on each of the lanes. If a charm would be played on a lane, the previous charm is destroyed.

Example:
    [Lava Field]
    cost: 3
    text: At the start of each player's turn, this lane deals 1 damage to each unit placed on it.



    = Treasure =
Treasures are cards with special effects. Unlike other cards, a player can have any number of treasures in play.
Treasures have life. If a Treasure's life would reach 0, it gets destroyed.
Treasures can be attacked by units.

Example:
    [Font of Life]
    cost: 5
    text: At the start of your turn, restore 2 life of all your units.



    = Spell =
Spells are cards that have a single effect. After that effect's resolution, they are discarded.

Example:
    [Ground Pound]
    Cost: 2
    Text: Deal 3 damage to target player or unit.



    = Bond =
Bonds are powerful cards that players start the game with already in play.
Bonds can be placed in decks.
Bonds can't be removed.

Example:
    [Perfection]
    text: When you place a Unit, if it has the same power and life, it gains TODO.
