    - !figure out how to send data from server on match end
        - possible solution: when creating match, send over a token, that identifies the match. every second or so, request, whether the match has ended. 
        - for that, create a list of all match tokens left. iterate through the list every time span. if got results for the match, delete it from the list
    - start match
        - need to be able to specify the number of matches
    - analize match results
    - report on crashes
